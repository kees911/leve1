    <h1>About Leve1</h1>
    <p><b>How do you pronounce Leve1?</b></p>
    <p>It's pronounced 'Level One'.</p>

    <p><b>Why?</b></p>
    <p>I wanted this to let people get their feet wet trying to do some basic code for the
        web, trying out some basic HTML and CSS; like a first step, a level one.</p>

    <p><b>Why not just use something like Wix or Squarespace, which are so much easier to use and have so many more features?</b></p>
    <p>Leve1 isn't so much of a website builder as it is an educational tool. The sites that you can make with Leve1 are, admittedly, going to be much more limited in function and aesthetics than one made on a major drag-and-drop website design sites these days. Though, there's a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that arises from making text styling work the way you wanted it to for the first time, and from realizing you might know a little bit of a coding language!</p>

    <p><b>Where did the theme names come from?</b></p>
    <p>The names are loosely based on the names of places where I once lived.</p>

    <p><b>What else have you done?</b></p>
